## TODO
Here are a list of things I would still like to do with this project
* Add argparse so that it is easier to: change output settings, pipe to file, change the word_pack used
* Option for stack vs queue?
* Double check the tests work, because I probably broke them
* Remove swear words from word packs?

python3 qless.py --word_pack WORDPACK -v () -vv
no v = number of solutions?
vv = the words
vvv = board states
or maybe --print_option [num_solutions, word_sets, full_result]
--file filename

--search [dfs, bfs]
